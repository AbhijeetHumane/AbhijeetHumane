Thanks for stopping by â€”  this is where I share my journey in **data analytics** â€” turning raw numbers into stories, patterns, and decisions.  
Iâ€™m passionate about **data-driven problem solving**, sharpening my skills with new tools, and making analytics approachable (and maybe even a little fun!).  

Here, youâ€™ll find:  

- ðŸ“ˆ **Projects** exploring real-world datasets and uncovering actionable insights  
- ðŸ›  **Dashboards & reports** built in Power BI, SQL, and Python to tell compelling data stories  
- ðŸ“š **Tips & techniques** Iâ€™ve picked up while cleaning, shaping, and visualizing messy data  

Whether youâ€™re here to learn something new, collaborate, or just see how another analyst tackles data challenges â€” youâ€™re in the right place! ðŸ“Š  

**Letâ€™s connect, analyze, and grow â€” one dataset at a time.**  
You bring the data, Iâ€™ll bring the insights ðŸ“‚ðŸ“‰
